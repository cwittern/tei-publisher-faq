Hosting TEI Publisher - or a custom edition generated by it - does involve administration steps not everyone is able to perform. This usually includes installing Java, eXist-db and securing your installation with a proxy, as well as retrieving a certificate for SSL and registering a host name.

Using a docker compose workflow can be a cheap and viable alternative, at least for smaller editions without much traffic to expect. Our docker compose configuration comes with everything preconfigured and you don't need to install any dependencies by hand. It also simplifies occasional updates and general maintenance. On the downside, it will likely not perform or scale as good as a dedicated server. In particular, rendering longer chunks of TEI (as we do for the TEI Guidelines app used as example below) will be considerably slower. But for smaller edition projects this may not be a problem.

The docker compose configuration is documented in detail in the [README](https://github.com/eeditiones/teipublisher-docker-compose) of the git repository. However, this might be a bit too dense for inexperienced users, so we'll provide a step by step instruction based on an actual example in the following sections.

### Example Application

As an example we'll use the [TEI Guidelines app](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-guidelines). This is a rather simple application generated from TEI Publisher 7, which provides an easy-to-browse version of the current TEI P5 Guidelines.

While the docker compose workflow was primarily created with TEI Publisher 8 in mind (not released yet at the time of writing), it will work also with applications generated from Publisher 6 or 7.

### 1. Choosing a Provider

First we have to find a provider, ideally offering a cloud-based virtual machine with docker preinstalled. There are many options and you have to do some research yourself. For this walk-through, we'll choose a [Hetzner cloud server](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) with 4gb of RAM, 2 virtual CPUs and 40gb SSD space.

When configuring the server, we select the *Docker CE* image instead of an OS image. This comes with docker preinstalled. The web interface then suggests a matching server configuration, but we'll choose a slightly less powerful one. You may also want to upload an ssh key (for easier access later).

### 2. Configuring DNS

Once the server has been created, you want to map it to a domain you own. How this is done exactly depends on who is managing your domain. It might be the university - in which case you have to contact them - or you bought your own domain somewhere, where you can manage it. Also, different server providers may have different suggestions about how to establish the DNS mapping in the correct way. Therefore check for instructions by your provider.

For our example, it will be enough to add a "type A" DNS entry mapping `demo.teipublisher.com` to the IP of the just created server. You can use the `dig` command locally or on your server to see if the DNS mapping worked (it may take a while). In our case the output shows the following, which is correct for our demo:

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
demo.teipublisher.com.	86400	IN	A	65.21.105.16
```

### 3. Create a Dockerfile for your app

In order to run our target application - the TEI P5 guidelines - within docker, we need to have a `Dockerfile`. The easiest approach is to copy the [template](https://github.com/eeditiones/teipublisher-docker-compose/blob/master/Dockerfile.tmpl) provided in the `teipublisher-docker-compose` repository into the root of your application (name it `Dockerfile`) and then modify it:

* Change `MY_EDITION_VERSION` to the name of your application repository and point it to the branch you want to build:
  ```
  ARG TEI_GUIDELINES_VERSION=master
  ```
* Edit the `git clone` command to build from your git repo:
  ```
    # Replace git URL below to point to your git repository 
    RUN  git clone https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-guidelines.git \
        && cd tei-guidelines \
        && echo Checking out ${TEI_GUIDELINES_VERSION} \
        && git checkout ${TEI_GUIDELINES_VERSION} \
        && ant
  ```
* Modify the COPY instruction below:
  ```
  COPY --from=tei /tmp/tei-guidelines/build/*.xar /exist/autodeploy/
  ```

Test your docker build with e.g.:

```sh
docker build --pull --rm -f Dockerfile -t teiguidelines:latest .
```

and run it locally to see if everything is ok:

```sh
docker run -p 8081:8080 --name teiguidelines teiguidelines:latest
```

If everything works, push the Dockerfile to your repository. For reference, the Dockerfile create for the TEI Guidelines using above steps is [available on github](https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-guidelines/blob/master/Dockerfile).

#### Note for TEI Publisher 6 and 7

If you created your app from TEI Publisher 6 or 7, you should also change definition of variable `$config:context-path` in `modules/config.xqm`. The old definition looked as follows:

```xquery
declare variable $config:context-path :=
   request:get-context-path() || substring-after($config:app-root, "/db")
    (: "" :)
;
```

Change this to

```xquery
declare variable $config:context-path :=
    let $prop := util:system-property("teipublisher.context-path")
    return
        if (empty($prop) or $prop = "auto") then
            request:get-context-path() || substring-after($config:app-root, "/db")
        else
            $prop
;
```

This small change will allow us to modify the context path of the application via an environment variable.

### 4. Fork the docker compose repository

On github, create a fork of the [teipublisher-docker-compose](https://github.com/eeditiones/teipublisher-docker-compose/) repository into your own or your organizations github account. You may also rename it, e.g. to `guidelines-docker-compose`.

Clone the forked repository to your local disk, so we can start modifying it: open the `docker-compose.yml` and change `services.publisher.build.context` to point to your app repository:

```
build:
    context: https://github.com/eeditiones/tei-guidelines.git#master
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

{{% notice note %}}
Unless you are using TEI Publisher 8 (not released yet at time of writing) or a development build, you can also delete the entire `ner:` section from `docker-compose.yml`. The ner (named entity recognition) service is only used within the annotations editor, so you can also remove this if you do not plan to annotate documents.
{{% /notice %}}

And in `conf/default.conf` change the two occurrences of `/apps/tei-publisher` into `/apps/guidelines` or whatever your edition application is called when installed in eXist:

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://docker-publisher/exist/apps/guidelines$request_uri;
    proxy_redirect http://$host/exist/apps/guidelines/ /;
    ...
}
```

Build the configuration once to make sure it works:

```sh
docker compose build --build-arg ADMIN_PASS=my_pass
```

{{% notice note %}}
Depending on the version of docker compose installed on your system, the command to use may either be `docker compose` (as shown above) or `docker-compose`. Both work the same. So for the following sections, if we write `docker compose`, you may have to replace it with `docker-compose` on your machine (or server).
{{% /notice %}}

Afterwards you can launch the docker compose config locally to check if everything went fine:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You should be able to access your application via `http://localhost`.

Next, we want to prepare the configuration for our newly created server. For this we have to provide an nginx configuration file matching the name we chose for our server (when configuring DNS above). Rename `example.com.tmpl` accordingly and add a `.conf` suffix, i.e. for our demo: `demo.teipublisher.com.conf`. Open the file and edit it as follows (make sure to also apply the edits to the commented out section at the bottom):

1. choose a unique name for the upstream server:
   ```
    upstream docker-guidelines-publisher {
        server publisher:8080 fail_timeout=0;
    }
    ```
2. replace the other two occurrences of `docker-publisher` with this name
3. change the `server_name` to the name of your server:
    ```
    server_name demo.teipublisher.com;
    ```
4. replace the other occurrences of `example.com` with your new server name
5. also again change `/apps/tei-publisher` into `/apps/guidelines` or whatever your edition application is called when installed in eXist.

For reference, our final config looks as below. The large commented out section at the end will be enabled later.

```
# Configuration for TEI Publisher with virtual host and SSL

# change name of upstream server below to something unique
upstream docker-guidelines-publisher {
  server publisher:8080 fail_timeout=0;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;

  server_name demo.teipublisher.com;
  server_tokens off;

  # Required by letsencrypt certbot to acquire certificate
  location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
      root /var/www/certbot;
  }

  location / {
    return 301 https://demo.teipublisher.com$request_uri;
  }
}

# Comment in the following section after acquiring an SSL certificate and make the required changes as
# indicated below

# server {
#   listen 443 ssl;
#   listen [::]:443 ssl;

#   server_name demo.teipublisher.com;

#   ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/live/demo.teipublisher.com/fullchain.pem;
#   ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/live/demo.teipublisher.com/privkey.pem;

#   location / {
#     # change upstream server placeholder 'docker-publisher' below to what you configured above for upstream
#     proxy_pass http://docker-guidelines-publisher/exist/apps/guidelines$request_uri;
#     proxy_redirect http://$host/exist/apps/guidelines/ /;
#     proxy_set_header   Host $host;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
#     proxy_ssl_server_name on;
#     proxy_cookie_path /exist /;
#     client_max_body_size  512m;
#   }

#   location /apps/eXide {
#     # change upstream server placeholder 'docker-publisher' below to what you configured above for upstream
#     proxy_pass http://docker-guidelines-publisher/exist$request_uri;
#     proxy_redirect     off;
#     proxy_set_header   Host $host;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
#     proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Host $server_name;
#     proxy_ssl_server_name on;
#     proxy_cookie_path /exist /;
#     client_max_body_size  512m;
#   }
# }
```

Commit and push the changes to your fork of `teipublisher-docker-compose`. You can also compare your changes with mine by checking [this commit](https://github.com/wolfgangmm/guidelines-docker-compose/commit/801a427075436be783a9d543294e11d6a1df8d68).

### 5. Set up the Server

Use SSH to connect to the server you created in step 1. Exact instructions on how to SSH into your server should be available from your provider. On the server make sure you have a git client installed. If yes, clone your docker compose configuration repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wolfgangmm/guidelines-docker-compose.git
```

Check if you can run either the `docker compose version` or `docker-compose version` command. They are not available everywhere, even if docker is installed. If none of the two can be found, follow the instructions in the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on how to install them. We suggest docker compose v2, though v1 will also work. They just differ in the commands used (`docker-compose` for v1).

Change into the directory and build it:

```sh
docker compose build --build-arg ADMIN_PASS=my_pass
```

where `my_pass` should specify the password for the eXist admin user.

Run the configuration once in order to obtain SSL certificates:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Start the registration with the following command, making sure that you use the full name of your host in the `-d` parameter:

```sh
docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d demo.teipublisher.com
```

The output should be as follows:


```sh
root@teipublisher-test:~/guidelines-docker-compose# docker compose run --rm  certbot certonly --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/certbot/ -d demo.teipublisher.com

```

Afterwards, edit your nginx configuration (`conf/demo.teipublisher.com.conf`) and remove the `#` comment sign from each line of the second `server` section.

Restart the docker compose configuration to apply the changes:

```sh
docker compose restart
```

You should now be able to access your server by its new name using `https` instead of `http`, e.g. https://demo.teipublisher.com.

For reference, you can also check my [final commit](https://github.com/wolfgangmm/guidelines-docker-compose/commit/de0a08b9d29afd5df9be63cee5a8b8838bc93003) with the changes made in this section.

### 6. Final Steps

Edit `docker-compose.yml` to make sure your service is automatically restarted if the server reboots. To do this, remove the comment around `restart: always`.
